# MFE-first-glance

Demo project for learning how to create MFEs with ModuleFederationPlugin for Webpack.

If you wanna try it out, npm i in each of the folders inside this repository.

Then in a separate terminal for each MFE/container, run ```npm run webpack``` (run container last).

Go to localhost:8080 and you will see text from each MFE running on the container's port!
